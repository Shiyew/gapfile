Changes in 1.1:

Repackaged as Cordova/PhoneGap 3.0-compatible plugin.

The gapFile object has been renamed GapFile to be consistent with usage in other plugins.

Internal docs in gapfile.js have been removed.

Changes from first (unversioned) release:

Changed deprecated toURI() call to toURL(). You will need to change this back if you're using a version of PhoneGap prior to 1.8.

GapFile.writeFile returns the full file URL to the success callback for added convenience.
